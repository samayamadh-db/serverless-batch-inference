# Retail Sales Forecasting with Databricks Model Serving

End-to-end time series forecasting solution using scikit-learn, MLflow, and Databricks Model Serving.

## Overview

This repository contains three Databricks notebooks that demonstrate:
1. Generating synthetic retail sales data
2. Training and deploying a forecasting model
3. Running batch predictions at scale

## Files

### 1. `00_generate_retail_sales_data`
Generates realistic synthetic retail sales data with temporal patterns.

**Features:**
- Multi-store, multi-product transactions
- Seasonal effects (weekends, holidays, summer)
- Growth trends over time
- Saves to Databricks Unity Catalog

**Usage:**
```python
# Update catalog and schema names
catalog = "your_catalog"
schema = "your_schema"

# Run notebook to generate ~200K+ transaction records
```

**Output:** `retail_sales_forecast` table in Unity Catalog

### 2. `01_train_and_deploy_forecasting_model`
Trains a scikit-learn LinearRegression model and deploys to Model Serving.

**Features:**
- Time-based feature engineering
- Train/test split with evaluation metrics
- MLflow model registration in Unity Catalog
- Automatic deployment to Model Serving endpoint
- Model aliasing for production management

**Requirements:**
- Pro or Serverless SQL warehouse
- Unity Catalog enabled workspace

**Usage:**
```python
# Configure your Unity Catalog
catalog = "your_catalog"
schema = "your_schema"
model_name = f"{catalog}.{schema}.retail_forecast_model"
endpoint_name = "retail-forecast-endpoint"

# Run notebook - it will:
# 1. Train the model
# 2. Register to Unity Catalog
# 3. Deploy to Model Serving
```

**Output:** 
- Registered model in Unity Catalog
- Live Model Serving endpoint

### 3. `02_batch_inference_ai_query`
Generates batch forecasts using the MLflow Deployments SDK.

**Features:**
- Single and batch predictions
- Multiple forecast horizons (7, 30, 90 days)
- Multi-store processing
- Automatic table creation and storage
- Visualization-ready outputs

**Usage:**
```python
from mlflow.deployments import get_deploy_client

client = get_deploy_client("databricks")

# Single prediction
result = client.predict(
    endpoint="retail-forecast-endpoint",
    inputs={"dataframe_records": [{"periods": 30}]}
)

# Batch processing
# Run the notebook for automated batch forecasting
```

**Output Tables:**
- `daily_forecasts` - Single store forecasts
- `batch_forecasts` - Multi-store forecasts
- `scenario_forecasts` - Multiple time horizons

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Databricks workspace (AWS, Azure, or GCP)
- Unity Catalog enabled
- Pro or Serverless SQL warehouse
- Cluster with ML runtime (13.3 LTS ML or higher)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your Databricks workspace
2. Update configuration variables in each notebook:
   - `catalog`: Your Unity Catalog name
   - `schema`: Your schema name
   - `endpoint_name`: Your model serving endpoint name

3. Run notebooks in order:
   ```
   1. data_generation.py
   2. model_training_deployment.py
   3. batch_predictions.py
   ```

## Model Details

**Algorithm:** scikit-learn LinearRegression

**Features:**
- Day index (days since start)
- Day of week (0-6)
- Month (1-12)

**Output:**
```json
[
  {
    "date": "2025-01-01",
    "forecast": 8500.50,
    "forecast_lower": 7650.45,
    "forecast_upper": 9350.55
  }
]
```

## API Usage

### Model Serving Endpoint

**Input:**
```python
{
  "dataframe_records": [
    {"periods": 30}  # Number of days to forecast
  ]
}
```

**Output:**
```python
[
  {"date": "2025-01-01", "forecast": 8500.50, ...},
  {"date": "2025-01-02", "forecast": 8524.56, ...},
  ...
]
```

### Python SDK
```python
from mlflow.deployments import get_deploy_client

client = get_deploy_client("databricks")
predictions = client.predict(
    endpoint="retail-forecast-endpoint",
    inputs={"dataframe_records": [{"periods": 30}]}
)
```

## Tables Schema

### retail_sales_forecast (input data)
| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| date | DATE | Transaction date |
| store_id | STRING | Store identifier |
| region | STRING | Store region |
| final_sales | DOUBLE | Sales amount |

### daily_forecasts (predictions)
| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| forecast_timestamp | TIMESTAMP | When forecast was made |
| store_id | STRING | Store identifier |
| date | STRING | Forecast date |
| forecast | DOUBLE | Predicted sales |
| forecast_lower | DOUBLE | Lower bound (90% CI) |
| forecast_upper | DOUBLE | Upper bound (90% CI) |

## Performance

- **Training time:** ~30 seconds (single store)
- **Prediction latency:** ~200ms for 30-day forecast
- **Batch throughput:** ~1000 forecasts/minute
- **Model size:** <5 MB

## Limitations

- Model trained on single store (S001) - extend for multi-store
- Simple linear model - consider more complex algorithms for production
- No hyperparameter tuning implemented
- 10% confidence intervals are approximations

## Troubleshooting

**Model serving endpoint not ready:**
- Wait 1-2 minutes after deployment
- Check endpoint status in Model Serving UI

**Permission errors:**
- Ensure you have USE CATALOG and USE SCHEMA privileges
- Verify CREATE MODEL privileges on the schema

**Prediction errors:**
- Verify endpoint is in "Ready" state
- Check input format matches expected schema
